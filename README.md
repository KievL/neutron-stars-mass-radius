# Models for nuclear interactions on neutron stars

In this project, two models are built considering the nuclear interactions on dense matter of neutron stars.
The first model is parametrized with empirical interactions. The second was made using Skyrme parametrization.
The EoS for both models are used to resolve the TOV equation and find the mass-radius relation. This project follows [Compact Stars For Undergraduates](https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0506417).

The main file is [nuclear-interactions.ipynb](https://github.com/KievL/neutron-stars-mass-radius/blob/main/nuclear-interactions.ipynb).
